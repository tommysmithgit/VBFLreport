device_50 - miner mines a block in 0.34215259552001953 seconds.
miner device_50 is propagating its mined block to miner device_10.
miner device_10 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_50
 Step 6 - miners decide if adding a propagated block or its own mined block as the legitimate block, and request its associated devices to download this block
