 Step 4.5 - with the broadcasted validator transactions, miners decide the final transaction arrival order
 
device_2 - miner 1/4 calculating the final transactions arrival order by combining the direct worker transactions received and received broadcasted transactions...
device_2 - miner 1/4 done calculating the ordered final transactions arrival order. Total 60 accepted transactions.
device_16 - miner 2/4 calculating the final transactions arrival order by combining the direct worker transactions received and received broadcasted transactions...
device_16 - miner 2/4 done calculating the ordered final transactions arrival order. Total 60 accepted transactions.
device_18 - miner 3/4 calculating the final transactions arrival order by combining the direct worker transactions received and received broadcasted transactions...
device_18 - miner 3/4 done calculating the ordered final transactions arrival order. Total 60 accepted transactions.
device_5 - miner 4/4 calculating the final transactions arrival order by combining the direct worker transactions received and received broadcasted transactions...
device_5 - miner 4/4 done calculating the ordered final transactions arrival order. Total 60 accepted transactions.
 Step 5 - miners do self and cross-verification (verify validators' signature) by the order of transaction arrival time and record the transactions in the candidate block according to the limit size. Also mine and propagate the block.
