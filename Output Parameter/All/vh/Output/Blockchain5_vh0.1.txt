miner device_10 has broadcasted 24 validator transactions to miner device_7.
 Step 4.5 - with the broadcasted validator transactions, miners decide the final transaction arrival order
 
device_7 - miner 1/3 calculating the final transactions arrival order by combining the direct worker transactions received and received broadcasted transactions...
device_7 - miner 1/3 done calculating the ordered final transactions arrival order. Total 72 accepted transactions.
device_17 - miner 2/3 calculating the final transactions arrival order by combining the direct worker transactions received and received broadcasted transactions...
device_17 - miner 2/3 done calculating the ordered final transactions arrival order. Total 72 accepted transactions.
device_10 - miner 3/3 calculating the final transactions arrival order by combining the direct worker transactions received and received broadcasted transactions...
device_10 - miner 3/3 done calculating the ordered final transactions arrival order. Total 72 accepted transactions.
 Step 5 - miners do self and cross-verification (verify validators' signature) by the order of transaction arrival time and record the transactions in the candidate block according to the limit size. Also mine and propagate the block.
