 Step 3 - validators do self and cross-validation(validate local updates from workers) by the order of transaction arrival time.

validator device_49 is performing one epoch of local update and validation
validator device_49 locally updated model has accuracy 0.3908000886440277 on its local test set
device_49 - validator 1/18 is validating received worker transactions...
Signature of transaction from worker device_47 is verified by validator device_49!
validator updated model accuracy - 0.3908000886440277
